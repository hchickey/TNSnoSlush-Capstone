# Tennessee Sno Slush

Tennessee Sno Slush is an application I built that allows people to search snow cone places in the state of Tennessee and create snow cone flavors of their own. The primary user of the application will be anyone that grew up going and getting snow cones with their family like I did or all the foodies out there that like to try new foods. 

When the user logs in the app, they will be prompted to search for a snowcone location. When the user finds the snow cone location that they want to learn about they can "click" on a link of the picture that will then take them to a page where they can read about the the snow cone place's address, featured flavors and regular flavors. 

Users can create their own flavors and delete the flavors they've created. When the user clicks on the "submit" button they will be taken to a page where they can see all the flavors they've created. 

Snow cone places are hard to find with thier not being that many in the state of Tennessee and TN Sno Slush is created for users to be able to search snow cone places near them and see what type of flavors they have at each location.
